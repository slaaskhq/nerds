At Slaask, we're working really hard to create the best Slack based customer service app ever. Every day, we find ways to help our customers to help their own clients.

Our webapp is powered by a Ruby on Rails and Golang backend with some React and legacy Javascripts, and we love the way those technologies help us build apps that our customers will love.

In this blog, you'll find blog posts about our technological life, here at Slaask.
Enjoy your reading, and don't hesitate to drop us a line at founders@slaask.com
