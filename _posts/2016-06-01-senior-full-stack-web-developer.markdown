#### Looking to do something entirely different with the web development skills you've worked hard to obtain? Slaask.com is on the lookout for a web developer to reach new levels of awesomeness with!

--------------------------------------------

### But first, Slaask — what is it?
It's a startup that was launched one year ago by two pretty chill guys on a mission to strengthen the bond between business and customer. Their idea? To create the full experience of live chat conducted directly from within Slack.

*If you don't know what Slack is, definitely give them a look: [http://slack.com](http://slack.com). You'll see for yourself, it's magic.*

### Opportunity:
You'll be a part of a tight team consisting of between two and three other developers. You'll be working alongside one of the two co-founders and be directly involved in important company matters. We've got loads of projects in the pipeline and it will be all hands on deck going forward. Pertinent skills include frontend, backend (Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, golang), and if you're UI/UX-savvy all the better.

### Environment:
Just footsteps from the [Euratechnologies](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xlcd2l_visite-virtuelle-euratechnologies_tech) tech hub, in a friendly, relaxed and stimulating atmosphere. It's an ideal spot if the midsize startup atmosphere appeals to you.

### Conditions:
You'll probably love working with us if you:

- are motivated by the project itself,
- have an entrepreneurial spirit
- are looking for a more stimulating and constantly changing work environment
- love hats :wink: that is, thrive in a flexible working environment prone to sudden and frequent shifts in responsibility
- can hold your own in the English language*

*Due to our international customer base, English will definitely come in handy :wink:

### The Full Monty:

- Ruby on Rails/NodeJS.
- Golang.
- Integration (Html/Slim, CSS/Sass, especially Javascript!).
- In short, as they say: you're "full stack" :wink:

### Additional Useful Skills:

- Server Management.
- UI/UX Design.
- Can sing in tune.

### Location:

- [Lille, Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille) near [EuraTechnologies](https://paris.numa.co/Actualites/EuraTechnologies-a-huge-place-a-soul-and-a-true-source-of-inspiration-for-Le-Camping)
- [Paris, France] near [Gare du Nord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_du_Nord)
